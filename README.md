# The Jam Club 

Service attack with Uber cars. Have you ever wanted to invest $10000 to get as many cars as you could on a single street? Well, now you can do it. By using our simple Android app you can burn as much cash as you want and attack your desired location. And if youâ€™re just a villain but not as rich as Dr. Evil, you can take part too. Once you open the app, you can either choose to be Dr. Evil, pay and give life to the wildest road jam possible, or just be a regular villain and loan your Uber account to the system.

This was a hack done during the Uber Hackathon (http://challengepost.com/software/the-jam-club#updates)
